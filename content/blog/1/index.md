## What to expect from this blog

This blog will contain tutorials and walkthroughs of my personal projects as well as discussion on other technical topics. I'm starting with the obvious one, this blog!

In the next few blog posts we will drill into the nitty-gritty of creating a JAMstack blog with the Vue-based framework Nuxt.js and its @nuxt/content module, which will allow us to easily turn Markdown files into blog posts.

If that means nothing to you, don't worry: We will start with an overview of the terms mentioned in the previous paragraph as well as an explanation of the general purpose of the blog itself.

At this point the blog is functional, but very bare bones. Hence the following posts will also include tutorials on how to add new features.

Here's a short list of missing features that I can come up with off the top of my head:
* ### Better navigation between blog posts  
  More links should be added, such as buttons for next/previous post  
* ### A button that allows the user to print my resume as a PDF file  
  As the porpose of this blog (at this point at least) is mainly to be a landing page for recruiters, I wanted to create an easy way to print a decent-looking and up-to-date PDF of my resume.  
* ### Improving the search function  
  There is a functional search box, but it needs to be improved and styled.  
* ### A list of related blog posts  
  This might be a more advanced feature, but there could be a list of posts with related keywords on the bottom of each post
* ### Comments  
  As the blog uses no backend or database, reader comments will have to be added through an exteral service. I have no idea how yet, but this will definitely be explored in a later post.

Of course, not all of these features are necessary or even feasible, but it should still be interesting to try to implement them. You often learn more from failure than success after all!

## What not to expect from this blog

This will NOT be a personal blog. I'll do my best to spare you the sordid details of my life, however I might throw in a funny anecdote where appropriate.

So, please tag along whether you're someone who already knows how to code or someone eager to learn. My hope is to grow this blog from a mere recruiting tool to a fully realized platform for documenting my work. This is a start.

Yours truly,
