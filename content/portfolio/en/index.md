## Portfolio

I'm a career changer who started studying coding about four years ago, in the summer of 2017. I still remember the day
when I first started. It was June 1st.

After a long and unfulfilling time at my old job, my friend suggested we start an online programming course together. Having 
read on the news about high demand for coders, as well as just having a competitive streak, I said count me in.

The course, called CS50x, was given online by Harvard professor David Malan and his staff, and looked frankly intimidating.

Yet on that fateful first day, as I was staying up till the wee hours piecing together a silly
<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/164378114/">basketball game</a> with an educational, Lego-like programming
language called Scratch, I'd already decided what I wanted to do next in my life.

So, after devouring the course and teaching myself through various means for a little under two years, I finally found my
first coding gig in the spring of 2019. Hired as a consultant, I've since had the pleasure of working on different
projects for a total of two and a half years now.

At work I've mostly written Python, Java and JavaScript, in no particular order. On my own time I like to experiment and
learn new stuff, like recently I've been reading a lot about Android development with Kotlin and Flutter.
