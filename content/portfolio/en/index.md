## Introduction

I'm a career changer who started studying coding about four years ago, in the summer
of 2017. I still remember the day when I first started. It was June 1st.

After a long and unfulfilling time at my old job, my friend suggested we start an
online programming course together. Having read on the news about a high demand for
coders, as well as just having a competitive streak, I said count me in.

The course, called CS50x, was given online by Harvard professor David Malan and his
staff, and looked frankly intimidating.

Yet on that fateful first day, as I was staying up till the wee hours piecing
together a silly <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/164378114/">basketball
game</a> with an educational, Lego-like programming language called Scratch, I'd
already decided what I wanted to do next.

Event though the road to being employable seemed long and hard, I hadn't had this much fun
studying in a long time.

So, after devouring the course and teaching myself through various means for a
little under two years, I finally found my first coding gig in the spring of 2019.
Working as a consultant, I've since had the chance to work on few different projects
for a total of two and a half years now.

At work I've mostly written Python, Java and JavaScript, in no particular order.
On my own time I like to experiment and learn new stuff; most recently I've been
reading up with a lot of excitement about Android development with Kotlin and Flutter.

  ### Säteilytekniikan varastolista

  <img src="varastolista.png" class="float-right ml-3" alt="Screenshot of varastolista" />

  An inventory app I created as a student for my friend's department at the Hospital
  District of Helsinki.

  It's a fairly simple CRUD app that enables the user to find, add, edit, or delete
  spare parts.
 
  The parts list can also be imported or exported as an Excel file. A QR-code reader
  functionality that uses your phone camera can be used to input part numbers.
  
  Keywords: *Python, Django, JavaScript, jQuery, PostgreSQL, Instascan, Heroku*

  ### Monitorimittari

  <img src="monitorimittari.png" class="float-right ml-3" alt="Screenshot of monitorimittari" />

  Another program I made for the guys at the Hospital District of Helsinki.

  This one is a little Python-based GUI-program for logging test results with an
  LXscan spot luminance meter and saving them onto an .xlsx template, thus saving
  the engineer time and effort from having to log each result down by hand.

  The program is built using the PyQT5 library and the resulting Python files are
  rolled up into an .exe file using PyInstaller.
  
  Keywords: *Python, PyQt5, PyInstaller*

  ### dopepod

  <img src="dopepod.png" class="float-right ml-3" alt="Screenshot of dopepod" />

  A web app that catalogues free podcasts with the help of the iTunes API (and
  scrapes additional information from other sources).

  A user of the app is able to search and listen to hundreds of thousands of
  podcasts sorted by genre and language.

  A registered user is also able to subscribe to podcasts and to create a playlist.

  ### dop3pod

  <img src="dop3pod.png" class="float-right ml-3" alt="Screenshot of dop3pod" />

  Version 3.0 of my above-mentioned pet project. It aims to recreate similar
  functionality using more modern technologies and shall we say a more
  well-thought-out architecture.

  The most prominent additions to the project is an Android/iOS app developed with
  Flutter. 
  
  Keywords: *Python, Django Rest Framework, Celery, Redis, Go, Flutter, Docker,
  PostgreSQL, Scrapy, DigitalOcean*

  ### NoteOwl

  <img src="noteowl.png" class="float-right ml-3" alt="Screenshot of NoteOwl" />

  A web app that can be used for writing down notes and associating them with tasks on
  a calendar. It has colorful, draggable post-it notes that can be arranged and stacked
  howsoever one pleases.

  It uses React on the frontend and Node on the backend. The database is a cloud
  hosted MongoDB and the app itself is running on a Heroku cloud server. 
  
  Keywords: *JavaScript, Node, React, MongoDB, Heroku*
