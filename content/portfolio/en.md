## Introduction

I'm a career changer who started studying coding about four years ago, in the summer of 2017. I still remember the day when I first started. It was June 1st.

Having had a long and unfulfilling time at my old job, my friend got the great idea of starting an online programming course together. After reading on the news about a high demand for coders, as well as just having a competitive streak, I said count me in.

The course, called CS50x, was given online by Harvard professor David Malan and his staff, and looked frankly intimidating.

Yet on that fateful first day, as I was staying up till the wee hours piecing together a silly <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/164378114/">basketball game</a> with an educational, Lego-like programming language called Scratch, I'd already decided what I wanted to do next.

Even though the road to becoming employable seemed long and hard, I hadn't had this much fun while studying in a long time, if ever.

So, after devouring the course and teaching myself through various means for a little under two years, I finally found my first coding gig in the spring of 2019. Working as a consultant, I've since had the chance to work on a few different projects for just under three years now.

At work I've mostly been writing Python, Java and JavaScript, in no particular order. On my own time I like to experiment and learn new stuff; most recently I've been doing a lot of catching up on Android development with Kotlin and Flutter.

### Solidabis Oy

Software development as a consultant on various client projects in both backend and frontend roles, usually a mix of both. Started in March 2019, so I have close to three years worth of experience now.

Keywords: *Java, JavaScript, Python, PostgreSQL, Docker, Node, React, Spring, Azure, AWS, GraphQL, Robot Framework*

### Varastolista

<img src="varastolista.png" alt="Screenshot Varastolistasta" />

An inventory app I made as a student project for the radiation therapy department at the Meilahti hospital.

It's a fairly simple CRUD app that enables the user to find, add, edit, or delete spare parts on a list.

The parts list can also be imported or exported as an Excel file. A QR-code reader functionality that uses your phone camera can be used to input part numbers.

Keywords: *Python, Django, JavaScript, jQuery, PostgreSQL, Instascan, Heroku*

### Monitorimittari

<img src="monitorimittari.png" alt="Screenshot of Monitorimittari" />

Another program I made for the guys at the Hospital District of Helsinki.

The hospital engineers are tasked with monitoring the luminance level of displays connected to imaging devices. This little Python-based GUI-program is for logging test results with a USB-connected LXscan spot luminance meter and saving them straight onto an .xlsx template, thus saving the engineer valuable time and effort from having to log each result down by hand.

The program is built using the PyQT5 library and the resulting Python files are rolled up into an .exe file using PyInstaller.

Keywords: *Python, PyQt5, PyInstaller*

### dopepod

<img src="dopepod.png" alt="Screenshot of dopepod" />

A web app that catalogues free podcasts with the help of the iTunes API (and scrapes some additional information from other sources).

A user of the app is able to search and listen to hundreds of thousands of podcasts sorted by genre and language.

A registered user is also able to subscribe to podcasts and to create a playlist.

Keywords: *Python, Django, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL, Scrapy, DigitalOcean, Haystack, Elasticsearch*

### dop3pod

<img src="dop3pod.png" alt="Screenshot dop3podista" />

Version 3.0 of my above-mentioned pet project. It aims to recreate similar functionality using more modern technologies and shall we say a more well-thought-out architecture.

Perhaps the most interesting addition to the project is an Android/iOS app developed with Flutter.

Keywords: *Python, Django Rest Framework, Celery, Redis, Go, Flutter, Docker, PostgreSQL, Scrapy, DigitalOcean*

### NoteOwl

<img src="noteowl.png" alt="Screenshot of NoteOwl"/>

A web app that can be used for writing down notes and associating them with tasks on a calendar. It has colorful, draggable post-it notes that can be arranged and stacked howsoever one pleases.

It uses React on the frontend and Node & Express on the backend. The database is a cloud hosted MongoDB and the backend app itself is running on a Heroku cloud server.

Keywords: *JavaScript, Node, React, MongoDB, Heroku*
