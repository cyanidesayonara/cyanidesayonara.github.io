# Hi ツ

I'm Santtu Nykänen, a thirty-something fullstack-developer from Helsinki.

This website includes my <nuxt-link to="/portfolio">portfolio</nuxt-link> with work experience, personal projects,
education, etc. as well as links to 
related online profiles, such as <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/santtu-nykanen/'>LinkedIn</a> and 
<a href='https://github.com/cyanidesayonara'>GitHub</a>. 

To write about my projects in more depth, I've also started a <nuxt-link to="/blog">blog</nuxt-link>, where the first 
tutorial will show you how to create and develop new features for this very project.

Thanks for visiting!
