# Hi ツ

I'm Santtu Nykänen, a thirty-something fullstack developer from Helsinki.

This website includes my
<nuxt-link to="/portfolio/en">portfolio</nuxt-link>
with info about my
<nuxt-link to="/portfolio/en#work-experience">work experience</nuxt-link>,
<nuxt-link to="/portfolio/en#personal-projects">personal projects</nuxt-link>,
<nuxt-link to="/portfolio/en#education--other-courses">education</nuxt-link>,
etc. as well as links to online profiles, like
<a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/santtu-nykanen/'>LinkedIn</a>
and <a href='https://github.com/cyanidesayonara'>GitHub</a>.

In order to write about my projects in some more depth, I've also started a
<nuxt-link to="/blog/">blog</nuxt-link>, where the
<nuxt-link to="/blog/1">first tutorial</nuxt-link> will show you exactly how
this very project was developed.

Thanks for visiting!
